    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your grill or stovetop skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, gently mix the ground beef with salt and pepper. Avoid overmixing to keep the patties tender.</li>
        <li>Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and shape them into patties, making a slight indentation in the center of each patty to prevent puffing during cooking.</li>
        <li>Place the patties on the grill or skillet and cook for about 4-5 minutes on one side.</li>
        <li>Flip the patties and cook for an additional 3-4 minutes, adding cheese slices on top if desired, until the cheese is melted and the patties reach your preferred level of doneness.</li>
        <li>Toast the hamburger buns on the grill or in a toaster until lightly golden.</li>
        <li>Assemble the burgers by placing a patty on each bun, followed by lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, and your choice of condiments.</li>
